#Write a program that takes a filename (as an argument, use sys.argv that is) and a field name for sorting. The file will contain data in the following format:
#
#                        FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth
#                        Ali,Saleh,5/5/2005
#                        Manal,Saleh,5/9/2004
#                        Juha,Abdo,8/1/200
#                        Magas,Kisra,7/2/1999
#
#Your program should read the contents of the file and then write the data sorted in ascending order based in the second argument you read from the user.
#For example if your script is named sort_students.py then you will execute in this way:
#python sort_students.py DateOfBirth
#In this case the output should sorted by date of birth column.
#
#Consult your book on how to read and parse date objects. Or see here https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects
